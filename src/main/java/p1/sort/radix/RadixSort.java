/**
 * An implementation of the radix sort algorithm.
 *
 * <p> It is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that sorts the elements by assigning them into buckets depending
 * on the value of the element at the currently considered position. If all elements have been assigned to the buckets,
 * the elements are collected from the buckets, starting at the first bucket, and the process is repeated for the next position.
 * The process is repeated until the every element of every value has been considered. The amount of iterations needed
 * is equal to {@link #maxInputLength}. The index associated with an element at a position in a value is extracted using
 * the given {@link RadixIndexExtractor}.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the elements to be sorted.
